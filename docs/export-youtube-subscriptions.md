**The steps below as well as the resulting file name are different depending on your Google language
settings.**

1. Open [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/takeout/custom/youtube).
2. Check if you are on the right account, as you might be using a "brand" account on YouTube.
3. Under `Create a new export` choose `YouTube and YouTube Music`.
4. Click on `All YouTube data included` and only tick `subscriptions` in the dialog that opens.
5. Click on `Next step`, make sure `Export once` is chosen and click on `Create export`.
6. Wait until the export creation is finished, then on the same page click on `Download` under
   `Your latest export` that should now be visible.
6. Extract the downloaded archive and find the file `subscriptions.csv`.
7. While logged into your Invidious account go to Subscriptions -> Manage Subscriptions ->
   Import/Export -> Import YouTube subscriptions, select the file you just downloaded and click on
   `Import`.
